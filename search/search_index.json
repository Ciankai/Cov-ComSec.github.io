Nmap, types of scans & common commands Intro to THM Welcome to ComSec! Before starting this week, you will need to ensure that you have a virtual machine setup. We will be using Kali linux throughout the society, as it contains most of the tools that we will use. If you need a hand setting up your virtual machine, view the guide This Weeks Challenges This week we will be using Docker - if this is new to you, view our guide & troubleshooting advice - Docker for Dummies! Challenge 1 In this challenge, you will learn to use Nmap to identify running services, then finding the 2 flags hidden within the machine. Instructions Create a new suitable folder on your kali VM mkdir filename Navigate to that folder cd filepath Run the following command to fetch the docker file wget https://Cov-ComSec.github.io/w1-nmap/d1/docker-compose.yaml To start the container, run: sudo docker-compose up If you have issues refer to the in-depth guide above! Challenge 2 In this challenge, you will need to run Nmap to identify services, as they are running on more unusual ports. As well as this, you will need to gain access to the root account using a privilage esculation attack. This machine has 2 flags , but note that the first flag is the same as the first challenge. Instructions Follow steps above to create a new folder (note if you change the docker-compose file name this will not work) Run the following command to fetch the docker file wget https://Cov-ComSec.github.io/w1-nmap/d2/docker-compose.yaml Start the container Remember to submit your flags to the CTFd server!

If you do see this it means you are ready for playing. Minimize your shell open a new one and start scanning. Nmap Scan sudo nmap -sC -sV 172 .18.0.1 It looks like we have 4 ports open 21,25,80,8080 Lets navigate to http://172.18.0.1 If you look at your nmap scan you can see that u have something like \"/ftp-uploads\" so this a directory in the website let's see whats going on in there. We have a folder called a anonymous let's see what's inside. Hm a file called FTPflag.txt looks like we found the first flag. Good Job! So you have one flag.To be honest this flag works more like a hint to tell you what you should do after this. So if you go back to your nmap scan you will see that you have a line \"21/tcp open ftp Pure-ftp\" so we have a file transfer protocol it is always good to check as this can sometimes be used for file upload to the machine you are attacking. But what's the mean of ftp-anonymous if you do a fast google search you will find out that when this happens you can have acces to ftp server without having to know the credentials.So lets try to connect to the ftp. ftp 172 .18.0.1 You will be asked to input the Name. You just have to type anonymous to connect. If you do a \"ls\" you will be able do see the a file called FTPflag.txt which is the same file you found in the website. You type help you will see as the commands that you can use inside the ftp, we want to upload p0wnyshell so that we can get access to the machine through the browser. For now you just need to know that we are using p0wnyshell as our reverse-shell. So \"ctrl+c\" to stop the ftp connection clone p0wny shell repository P0wny-Shell . cd p0wny-shell ftp 127 .18.0.1 put shell.php The last command is going to upload our shell. If you go back to your browser and back to \"/ftp-uploads/anonymous\" you will see the file shell.php in there clicked and you will have p0wny-shell. So you succefully entered the machine. Let's look for the last flag. A easy way to find files on linux is using the file command. find / -name \"*.txt\" 2 >/dev/null Congratulations! Lets move to docker2 Nmap 2 So to prove how important is nmap we setup a second nmap challenge but right now we not following the common ports as you can see in here. We mangled the ports sudo nmap -sC -sV 192 .168.42.1 -p- In this challenge the ftp part is the same as the first challenge and the first flag is the same, the only difference is that the ports have been changed so if you to \"http://192.168.42.1\" the website is not going to load you need to instead look for something like this \"192.168.42.1:8080\". So lets pass to the second part uploading files to ftp. We have ftp running on port 2121 (2121/tcp ccproxy-ftp) last time you use \"ftp $ip\" to connect this time that wont work cause you will need to specify the port os instead use something like this \"ftp $ip port\" ftp 192 .168.42.1 2121 Again use anonymous as login. In this challegne we introduced privesc so we will need a scrip to enumerate all te services that are being run on the machine, file permissions, file types, sym links ,etc. There are 2 that are I know, LinEnum and linpeas. I prefer linpeas , instead of cloning the repository what I did is I open my prefered text editor on my kali box and I just copy/pasted the script. Then I stopped the ftp connection I cd to the directory where I have linpeas, I started the connection again and use the \"put linpeas.sh\" to copy linpeas to the machine. Besides linpeas we will need a php reverse shell, cause p0wny shell is not going to work in this challenge. Another good resource to put in your bookmarks, PentestMonkeys I did the same process with both linpeas and the php-reverse-shell so open your editor and \"ctrl+c / ctrl+v\" put hte ip of your kali box in the line where you see \"\" \\change this\" and upload the file to the ftp. So right now you should see something like this Which means you ready. Open a terminal and start netcat. nc -lvnp 1234 Go to \"192.168.42.1:8080/ftp-uploads/php-reverse-shell.php\" the site should be loading for ever. If you go back to your terminal you should have access to the box. Tip: everytime I get a reverse shell I try to find out what user I am. whoami Lets not forget we are in /var/www , we need to copy our linpeas script to tmp folder. cp linpeas.sh /tmp chmod +x linpeas.sh ./linpeash.sh Take a look at the output and try to find the SUID section. If you don't know SUID is a type of permission that you have on linux that let's the user run the file or binary. That last line mentioning vim.basic maybe we can do some research and see how we can exploit it. Fortunately there is a good resource called \"GTFOBINS\" which is used for looking how we can exploit binaries look for vim and you will see that you can spawn a shell inside vim or using the command. :!/bin/sh #or vim -c ':!/bin/sh' Now you are root! cd /root cat flag.txt Congrats!

So we have one port open 3838/tcp and we have at least one directory '/legal' and one file robots.txt and the box is running nginx. First thing lets open the browser and navigate to 172.17.0.2 Get a good look at the source code and the style.css and should be able to find the flag1. Well this week is all about list and enumerating web apps so let's do it. You have a lot of tools from gobuster, ffuf, dirbuster and etc. I'll be using dirbuster. Dirbuster is better for recursion. Looks like we have a lot more inside this Web App. Robots.txt Lets go to robots.txt. Robots.txt is always a good spot to look for flags in ctfs and sometimes u can get information about other directories will you wait for your scans and scripts to end. You should have one flag2. /legal/ How boring can we be? Actually is always good to remind you guys we are living in the grey area. Here you have the first 2 sections of the Computer Misuse act 1990. Opens your eyes cause in the middle of all of those words you should be able to find flag3 you just need to loose and 10 secs in cyberchef and one more is done. /legal/papers Hm how good are you at web dev? Do you guys know which tags you can use while inserting an image? Do you what the alt tag does? If you don't while do a brief explanation. So inside the alt='' tag you will have alternate text that will be shown when the image cannot be displayed. Look at the alt tag for this image and flag4 is done. 404 404 is a page that can be really important for the attacker if not well setup. From the 404 page we can sometimes extract important information for example the version of the distro or server ,etc. This kinds of information can be really important sometimes to find CVES and other vulns. By the Way always check the source code. .well-known/security.txt Have you heard of this directory before if you don't you can get an idea security.txt . Always good to check. Flag.txt Looks like we can't see this file maybe after getting our reverse shell we will be able to. wp-content Let's go back to the dirbuster scan, you have a page called wp-content. For the people that don't know this is the standard page for uploading files in wordpress. Get your reverse shells from pentestmonkeys upload the file. It will appear as a link in the same page. Before clicking it, run your netcat in the terminal nc -lvnp 1234 Go back to the browser and click the file and you should have the tty. Navigate to /var/www/ and cat the flag.txt Flag7 only one left. Let's get root. So without using any script lets enumerate the SUID permissions using find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null Looks like we can run sudo. Lets look for the permissions. sudo -l If you do id now you will be able to see you are root. cat /root/flag.txt Done Congrats!","title":"Writeup"},{"location":"w2-webenum/writeup/#week-2","text":"Web Enumeration ctf So you know start your docker instances and let's hack! 8 Flags inside this machine Every time first thing to do Nmap scan Look at your scan results.

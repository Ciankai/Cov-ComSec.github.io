This week we had a talk by a second-year student, 0verfl0w_ about banking malware and his experience while working as a Principal Security Analyst. Additionally, he has developed a Beginner Malware Analysis Course, Zero2Automated, and worked with SentinelOne to develop free online training courses.

Here is a copy of the [presentation](bankingMalware.pdf). If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to @0verfl0w_ on Twitter.

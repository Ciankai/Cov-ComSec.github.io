## Legal & Terms of Use

!!! warning
    Please note that topics on this site will cover hacking, however this is intended for educational use only & we condem it from being used in any unethical way.

    As well as this, do not attack any machine that you do not own, unless you have prior written consent from the owner. As a rule of thumb, if you are unsure if you are allowed to do something, you probably aren't! We would like to take this time to remind you of the [Computer Misuse Act 1990](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents){target=_blank} or your local equivilent.

## Got a Question?

!!! question
    If you have a question or you are stuck on a challenge, feel free to ask us - we don't bite! The best way to contact us is via the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7SF7NKG){target=_blank}. Feel free to post a question in one of the channels, or if you're shy, send anyone in the committee a direct message.

## Mistakes or Suggestions?

!!! bug
    Unfortunately we are ethical hackers, and not graphics designers (we are used to spending 90% of our time in terminals), so if you have a suggestion to improve our content, let us know! We are also only human, so there is a high likelihood that we have made a syntax error  on a webpage or presentation or have a bug in a piece of code or challenge.

    If you spot an error in our site/or have a suggestion, please either:

    - [Fork the repository](https://github.com/Cov-ComSec/Cov-ComSec.github.io){target=_blank}, correct the error & create a pull request.
    - Create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Cov-ComSec/Cov-ComSec.github.io/issues){target=_blank}.
    - Contact us on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7SF7NKG){target=_blank}.

    All editors will be credited (unless you wish to remain anonymous).

In these sessions we hope to complete challenges from [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/){target=_blank} and [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com/){target=_blank}. We will also aim to play games, like king of the hill (KOTH).

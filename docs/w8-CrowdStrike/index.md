# Week 8 - CrowdStrike Event
Wednesday 4th December 2020 | Page Author: Jack Orcherton

## Our University has been hacked!!!!
CrowdStrike and ComSec request your help in identifying the malicious attackers. Can you help us identify the attackers before Warwick, Southampton and Edinburgh Napier do?

This week we will complete a blue team, security operation centre type challenge!

Unfortunately places are limited this week, and require booking in advance - to book view our post on either Aula or Discord

## Who are CrowdStrike? 
'CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 to fix a fundamental problem: The sophisticated attacks that were forcing the world’s leading businesses into the headlines could not be solved with existing malware-based defences. Co-founders George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch realized that a brand new approach was needed — one that combines the most advanced endpoint protection with expert intelligence to pinpoint the adversaries perpetrating the attacks, not just the malware.'

## Disclaimer
If you haven't already guessed, and to cover our backs (for legal purposes) the university has not been hacked and this is a blue team simulation experience (the university infrastructure will not be touched in any way)
